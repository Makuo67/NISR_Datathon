## Data Used

Our interactive dashboard relies on two primary datasets: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. These datasets, sourced from NISR, serve as the foundation for our visualizations and analyses, offering a comprehensive view of Rwanda's economic landscape in 2022.

## DashBoard Information

The dashboard aims to communicate key insights derived from the GDP and CPI datasets. Through visually compelling charts, graphs, and maps, users can explore trends, sectoral breakdowns, and global comparisons, gaining a deeper understanding of Rwanda's economic performance in 2022.

## How to Interact

1. **GDP Overview:** Explore the economic heartbeat of Rwanda, analyzing major contributors to GDP growth and sectoral dynamics.

2. **Sectoral Breakdown:** Delve deeper into specific sectors driving economic growth, understanding their individual impacts on the overall GDP.

3. **CPI Insights:** Navigate inflation and consumer purchasing power trends through intuitive visualizations, highlighting the cost of living.
